<h1>Implementation of the NIST CSF for a Growing Startup</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I implemented the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) at a fast-growing software startup, creating a scalable foundation for governance, risk reduction, and compliance readiness. Within six months, cybersecurity maturity advanced from ad hoc to developing, with measurable improvements across all CSF domains.

<h2>Key Actions</h2>

- Conducted a cybersecurity maturity assessment through interviews, policy reviews, and control testing.

= Developed a risk register, asset inventory, and governance roles.

- Implemented MFA, enhanced access controls, and introduced secure coding practices.

- Designed lightweight SIEM monitoring, critical event alerting, and the first Incident Response Plan.

- Established backup validation and recovery drills.

<h2>Results</h2>

The implementation strengthened governance, improved incident response, and introduced continuous monitoring, enhancing client trust and positioning the startup for future SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certification.
