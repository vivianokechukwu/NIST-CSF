<h1>Implementation of the NIST CSF for a Growing Startup</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I implemented the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) at a fast-growing software development startup. The organization required a scalable approach to strengthen cybersecurity governance, reduce operational risks, and prepare for client and regulatory expectations. Within six months, the implementation improved cybersecurity maturity from ad hoc to developing and positioned the startup for long-term compliance readiness.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

### Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment

- Conducted interviews with leadership, IT, and developers.<br>
- Reviewed existing security policies, access controls, and incident documentation.<br>
- Applied a maturity model to measure capabilities across CSF domains.

**Findings:** Strong product security but no centralized asset inventory, limited governance, and no formal incident response procedures.

<h2>Framework Alignment and Implementation </h2>

- **Identify:** Developed risk register, asset inventory, and governance roles.<br>
- **Protect:** Implemented MFA, updated access controls, introduced secure coding training.<br>
- **Detect:** Recommended a lightweight SIEM and designed critical event alerting.<br>
- **Respond:** Drafted and tested the first Incident Response Plan.<br>
- **Recover:** Established backup validation and recovery drill schedules.

<h2>Results</h2>

- Cybersecurity maturity improved from ad hoc to developing.<br>
- Formal governance structures, incident response capability, and SIEM monitoring introduced.<br>
- Strengthened client and partner confidence in the organizationâ€™s security posture.<br>
- Positioned for future compliance efforts (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
